Example with Gradle and Android Studio support.

To import project into Android Studio select **Import project** and specify path to the folder with sources.

To make it work do the next 2 things:
1) Put **HERE-sdk.jar** file with SDK into **<app_folder>/app/libs**
2) Put folder **armeabi-v7a** with native libraries into **<app_folder>/src/main/jniLibs**

Congratulations! Now you can build and run your app.
